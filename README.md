# Mini-Player for Discord

I was thinking about a smaller footprint Discord display, along the lines of the iTunes mini-player. A quick search brought me to the following Reddit thread: [It'd be nice to have a simple always-on-top, mini-discord without the need for injection into the video layer or other API trickery.](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/7pzbe6/itd_be_nice_to_have_a_simple_alwaysontop/)

I realize there is a Discord overlay, but that takes focus and is not helpful in the middle of a game. I have since learned about pinning in the overlay, which is much better. But this project may be worth pursuing nonetheless.
